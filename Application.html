    <h1>Michigan Equity Research</h1>
    <p>Michigan Equity Research Club, also known as MERC, is an undergraduate student organization at the University of Michigan focused on building the technical and behavioral competence of our members to succeed in equity research positions. MERC is the first equity research club at the University and is looking to assemble an analyst class for Fall 2021 then begin offering equity research services come Spring 2022. Incoming members will receive extensive training as developed by founding members with relevant experiences in related fields. And perhaps most importantly, members will be part of a family whose impact extends far beyond a professional network. Please see below to see common questions asked about MERC.</p>
