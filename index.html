      <p>Michigan Equity Research Club, also known as MERC, is an undergraduate student organization at the University of Michigan focused on building the technical and behavioral competence of our members to succeed in equity research positions. MERC is the first equity research club at the University and is looking to assemble an analyst class for Fall 2021 then begin offering equity research services come Spring 2022. Incoming members will receive extensive training as developed by founding members with relevant experiences in related fields. And perhaps most importantly, members will be part of a family whose impact extends far beyond a professional network. Please see below to see common questions asked about MERC.</p>

      <h2>What is the structure?</h2>
      <p>All members enter the club as Pupils, where they undergo a semester of club orientation, technical training, and professional development. After passing a final examination, they graduate to become club Analysts, where they conduct research on teams to offer (1) periodic economic and equity reports or (2) investment consulting projects for clients. At any point as an analyst, a member has the opportunity to run for club leadership, with elections held in December of each year. The entire club votes on the Managing Director, Director of Internal Affairs, and Director of External Affairs and this newly-elected E-Board then assigns Associates and Senior Analysts to different project teams. These lower leadership positions are held for one semester whereas E-Board positions are held for an entire year (December to December).</p>

      <h2>Why was MERC founded?</h2>
      <p>The organization was started by three sophomores with the intent of operating radically different from other undergraduate business clubs by upholding the ideal of transparency. Recognizing the importance of early undergraduate years for building technical and behavior competence, MERC is uniquely designed to provide all students an educational platform to better themselves; All educational resources will be posted on our (future) website for public use, personalized interview feedback will be provided to all final interviewees, and club operations are clearly outlined here. Operating transparently provides a more effective environment to educate students than typical club structures and can strengthen the quality of MERC resources by exposing them to external criticism that can improve their quality.</p>

      <h2>What is the MERC recruitment process like?</h2>
      <p>With a large and diverse UM undergraduate population, MERC recognizes that each candidate has unique values, abilities, and skills. Values include aspects such as motivations, missions, and overall character. Abilities include innate ways of thinking and creativity. Skills include preexisting knowledge or credentials. Other clubs rely heavily on skills to rank candidates. Instead, MERC judges fit primarily in terms of personality (values) and ways of thinking (abilities):
        <br>1. The first stage of the recruitment process includes a physical application submitted to MERCâ€™s E-Board via a Google Form. The application includes personal information and free-response questions gauging interest and equity research field understanding. We look for applications showing genuine interest and an adequate understanding of equity research with minimal emphasis on prior experiences or credentials. Decisions will be released soon after the application deadline.
        <br>2. The second stage includes a business professional interview testing applicant values. Questions will gauge interest and organization fit based on motivations, missions, and character. We look for applicants with a strong presence and clear and genuine answers in line with club values. Decisions will be released soon after the interview.
        <br>3. The third stage includes a business professional final interview testing mainly applicant abilities. Questions will test abilities to think critically, develop an answer, then explain clearly and concisely. The purpose of this interview is to gauge problem-solving abilities and creativity. Decisions will be released soon after the interview, with rejections coming with a detailed description of how to improve for next time.</p>

      <h2>What is the Michigan Equity Research Guide?</h2>
      <p>The Equity Research Guide is a culmination of insightful overviews, clear visuals, and case studies that will prepare club members for the intense yet exciting equity research environment. Even if your interests are outside the realm of equity research, this guide will nonetheless improve your business acumen. </p>
